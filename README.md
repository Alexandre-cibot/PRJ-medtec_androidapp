## Challenges and To Dos

### Mockups 
To drive your code, here's the MOCKUP that we have set with medical doctors, engineers and designers.

### Simulation

You'll find in `phantom/img_kydney.txt` and `phantom/img_obs.txt` the data that is output from the Hardware. The goal is to build and obtain from each of these double arrays the images stored respectively as `phantom/img_kydney.bmp` and `phantom/img_obs.bmp`.

The image `img_kydney.bmp` is more realistic than `img_obs.bmp`.
